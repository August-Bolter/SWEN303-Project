### Ahad and George
Not sure what personas are assigned to each use-case.
Repository = Course?


*  Create Account
*  Create Repository
*  Modify Repository
*  Login (is this too small to be a use-case on its own)?
*  Create Question
*  Answer Question
*  View Question

Only use-case I didn't include was commenting on questions. Though this is a nice feature of the website it isn't essential.

### Justina and Daniel
Again not sure what personas are assigned to each use-case.

*  Login
*  Take Quiz
*  Add Verified/Unverified Content
*  Verify content
*  Edit/delete content
*  Study topic

Didn't include choosing course (think it is too small), also didn't include give feedback (non essential feature)

### Mine

*  Creating a question (Students)
*  Answering and Rating questions (Students) - could probably just be shortened to Answering questions (since rating a question is part of answering it)
*  Course Creation and Activation (Staff) - could probably just be shortened to Course Creation
*  Registering (Students and Staff) - had two use-cases for this, one for instructor and one for student but it'd be more concise to just have one use-case for registering
*  Editing/Deleting questions (Students) - again had two use-cases for this but best to merge into one
*  Take Quiz (Students)

### Overall

**Students only**
*  Creating questions/quiz (included in add verified/unverified content)
*  Answering questions (included in study topic)
*  Editing/Deletng questions (same as edit/delete content)
*  Take Quiz

**Staff only**
*  Create Repository/Course
*  Edit Repository/Course
*  Verify content

**Students and staff**
*  Registration
*  Login
*  View question

Note:
Main conflict I see between our systems is Daniel and Justina system seems to have a different method for creating questions/quizzes then my system and ahad and george system. They use a verification system and have verified/unverified content whereas my system and ahad and george system does not make this distinction. We can't have both so we'd have to pick one.
