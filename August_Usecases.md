Not sure what personas are assigned to each use-case.
Repository = Course?

-Create Account
-Create Repository
-Modify Repository
-Login (is this too small to be a use-case on its own)?
-Create Question
-Answer Question
-View Question

Only use-case I didn't include was commenting on questions. Though this is a nice feature of the website it isn't essential.

### Justina and Daniel
Again not sure what personas are assigned to each use-case.
-Login
-Take Quiz
-Add Verified/Unverified Content
-Verify content
-Edit/delete content
-Study topic

Didn't include choosing course (think it is too small), also didn't include give feedback (non essential feature)

### Mine
-Creating a question (Students)
-Answering and Rating questions (Students) - could probably just be shortened to Answering questions (since rating a question is part of answering it)
-Course Creation and Activation (Staff) - could probably just be shortened to Course Creation
-Registering (Students and Staff) - had two use-cases for this, one for instructor and one for student but it'd be more concise to just have one use-case for registering
-Editing/Deleting questions (Students) - again had two use-cases for this but best to merge into one
-Take Quiz (Students)

### Overall

**Students only**
