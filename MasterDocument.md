## Part 1: Background

- more student focussed because 

### Existing Solution
Peerwise is an online learning tool created by Auckland University. It is used in addition to classes and tutorials to help further a student’s understanding of specific course content with minimal lecturer input. 
<br>

At the start of the college term or university trimester, an empty repository is created by the course coordinator. Students can then create questions, answer questions, rate questions and further discuss them.
<br>

While Peerwise has received a lot of positive user feedback, specifically relating to the opportunity to interact and engage with course material. The users also describe the _UI_ as underwhelming, boring and 'discouraging' due to the lacklustre appearance. Many students have stated how this unintuitive UI, has caused them to be less interested in using the app, and/has stopped them from using the app altogether.
<br>

Below, we have identified and listed the three main objectives of Peerwise:
1. Enable students to clarify their understanding and support their learning of each course / paper
2. Engage students with course content during trimesters
3. Allow students to learn by independently

However, keeping in mind the objectives listed above, there are also issues which we have found with the Peerwise application. The top three issues have been listed below: 
1. The app is / looks outdated
2. The app is unintuitive and can be hard / finicky to use
3. The app is incredibly boring - it is incredibly off-putting to potential users

The combination of the top three issues we have listed with the project is incredibly problematic. This is due to the fact that this combination causes the app to be unusable / the user to not want to use it, and that defeats the very purpose of the app in the first place. 
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________
#### Existing Solutions 
There are a number of systems that are similar to PeerWise such as Kahoot, GoSoapBox, and Wooclap. 
<br>

All these services have a large sign up/sign in banner at the top of their home page so that it’s the first thing that you see when you first visit the website. Below this they show people that have used their service. Each persons’ demographics and occupation are shown as well therefore, people visiting the website find it easier to identify whether they would use it since they can see if they are similar to the userbase. There are also quotes from these users explaining their positive experiences with it. This means visitors of the site will be more likely to use it. 
<br>

These services are similar to PeerWise because each one is catered for students and teachers. They all innovate traditional learning and make learning more interactive and fun for the students. They also have a much more streamlined registration page and have a tutorial on how to sign up. For example, GoSoapBox and Kahoot has a guide on how to get started right after signing up while PeerWise doesn’t. Each service also has a quicker way to register because the username, password and email fields are all on the same page. In comparison to PeerWise where you need to enter your school/institution, click on the register link and then the fields for each registration detail (username, password, course ID and identifier) are shown on separate pages. In particular, the most inconvenient aspect about PeerWise’s registration is that you can only find out your course ID and identifier from your course coordinator. 
<br>

These services also follow a minimalist design, reducing the amount of text shown on the screen to make sure the user is not overwhelmed with information. And each given text is isolated from other nearby text via a border or container which helps the user to take the information in at a good pace. This is shown in Kahoot’s home page after you login. These services also are more preferable to PeerWise in terms of creating a question or quiz. Take Wooclap for example, their way of creating questions and quizzes gives the user more freedom to customize questions and quizzes since they can have more multiple choice answers than PeerWise which only has 5 at a maximum. Wooclap, unlike PeerWise, allows questions to be in different formats such as polls, open questions, fill in the blank questions etc. These formats are presented in a drop-down list making it convenient for the user to change the format of their question.

#### Business Objectives
PeerWise is a tool instructors (secondary school teachers or university course coordinators) use to set up courses which students can join. Students can then create questions which other students can answer. Additionally, students can rate questions once they have answered them and can filter questions by their topic. They can also start quizzes which are an assortment of questions they have already answered. All these features contribute to PeerWise’s purpose which is to encourage student collaborative learning to ensure that the students have a deeper understanding of the course material

<br>
We have identified many issues with the PeerWise app. However, we have selected the most-pressing concerns and listed them below:
1. Peerwise has an outdated and inconvenient interface. It is not user-centric for the modern day student 
2. The registration process is long and convoluted
3. Peerwise doesn't follow very many of design rules.  It is hard to use, not very aesthetic and therefore off-putting.

<br>
In order to solve the issues that we have listed above we have decided that we need to create a modernised interface and design. We will be following the material design standards, which was created by Google. This is as it is a widely used standard, and is a familiar aesthetic to people today. Therefore we can trust that by following the standard, we will be able to achieve a website that people will like (aesthetically speaking). 
<br>

By having this improvement, it will make it easier for students to use PeerWise and they will be more incentivised to continue using it in the future. They will also be more likely to recommend it to family and friends. This will lead to a larger user-base that has more returning users (users that revisit PeerWise). It will also help with the key business objectives of PeerWise (listed below):
- Instructors can facilitate collaborative student learning through course creation and activation
- Students can have a deeper understanding of topics by explaining and discussing questions and their answers
- PeerWise has an easy-to-use, convenient and modernised interface and has an aesthetically pleasing design

### Stakeholder Information
Below we have listed the possible stakeholders along with the power and interests that they hold in the app. We have defined that those with;
- high power: _a person or entity who we want to satisify with our app functions etc._
- low power: _a person or entity who we aren't so concerned about meeting their needs with the app's functions_
- high interest: _a person or entity who would be highly interested in what the app can currently do, and the development of the app in the future_
- low interest: _a person or entity who is interested in the app, and would like to be occasionally updated as to what the app can do_


Identified stakeholders:
- Lecturers	    low power/High interest
- Students      high power/High interest
- University    low power/low interest

The reasoning for the above decisions are listed below:
Lecturer:
- We want this app to be more student centred as it is an app that is supposed to better _student learning_ not lecturer's ability to teach / conveying information to students. Therefore, we have reduced the lecturer to a low power status.
- We would assume that lecturers would be highly interested in app that would improve student's grades.

Students:
- As this is an app that is created for student use and to help student learning, we have made students a high power status. We care greatly about how they feel about the app, and whether they are enjoying the app or not.
- Students are also high interest individuals as they should be highly interested in what we plan to do with the app in the future etc. 

University:
- We have given the university a lower power status for the same reason we gave the lecturers a low power status. As it is an app that foccusses on students, and helping students learn, we won't worry so much about how the university enjoys the app and its functions. 
- We would assume that as the app is supposed to help students learn, then the unveristy would be interested in how the app functions, updates etc. for the app.

#### Importance to StakeHolders
PeerWise is important as it gives students another way to learn course material. If students keep learning in the same way they are more likely to become demotivated and unenthusiastic about learning so they will find it harder to take in course material. This might lead them to submitting lower quality assignments/projects and/or performing worse in exams. PeerWise is also important because it allows students to learn from each other and they can give each other different views and opinions on topics which they may not have thought about. This results in a much deeper understanding of the topic.<br>
PeerWise also helps teachers because it ensures that students aren’t relying solo on the teachers perspective of the topic. Having only one perspective of the topic can potentially create biases and can limit how well students can comprehend the material. This in turn may affect the students grades therefore it should be avoided. <br>
This also alleviates some of the teachers and professors workload by getting the students to help each other on topics that they are confused about, and the teacher won’t need to spend their time helping each troubled student individually. This means that teachers will be able to teach more topics to the students and/or dive deeper into the topics they are already teaching. <br>

### Business Objectives:
As mentioned above, we have identified three major issues with the current learning management systems. We believe that our app will address these issues and therefore it will make learning at university an incredibly fun, interesting and exciting experience. Which is why our app is so valuable. 

As students of the 21st century, we are becoming an increasingly diverse range of people. We now understand that there are an incredibly wide range of people, all with different learning abilities, and recognise that education should be accessible for everyone. The main issue with the current education system is that the way it is designed, it is only suited for a very specific, and minority group of people’s learning styles. Our learning system is designed to help students who may have different learning types to the one that we are used to teaching in schools. Our new, updated learning management system has been designed to help the course content be more accessible and understandable for the students. Therefore, it is obvious that our system’s main objectives is to create:

#### remake this list with group / check what they want aagin 
1. An easily navigable system that is intuitive to use
2. As a result, this app should support students to help pass their exams, and understand the course content better
3. Provide a system which the students can interact with each other as well as the teacher, and provide statistics to both the teacher and students in the class to understand how well the rest of the class is doing 
4. The app is designed to create a judge-free zone, allowing students to efficiently give feedback to the lecturers and increase the level constructive dialogue to lecturers
 
Justification for the main core functions
Our learning management system is supposed to be designed in such a way that is easy and accessible for everyone. While it is easy to assume that the large majority of students are used to technology and the basic, common layout for most apps, it is also important there are also a number of postgraduate, mature students as well as lecturers who may not necessarily be used to technology. Therefore it should be intuitive to use, even for people who aren’t used to technology. 

The learning management system is supposed to be a way to communicate the information to student(s) clearly, and concisely, removing all the excess, unneeded information. This is to cater to all students, especially those who are often confused by all the jargon that is used in lectures.

Many students are afraid to ask the lecturer questions during and after lectures or during office hours as they are afraid of being laughed at. This application will help reduce that anxiety for students as they can either directly ask the lecturer about the course without needing to see them face-to-face or post on the board where they aren’t physically confronted by the other students or lecturer.




## Part 2: Personas 

### Selected personas in order of priority (from most to least important):

* [Student Engaged - Sally](https://gitlab.ecs.vuw.ac.nz/course-work/swen303/2020/project1/t16/swen303-project/-/blob/master/Personas/Engaged_Student.pdf)
* [Student Disengaed - Liam](https://gitlab.ecs.vuw.ac.nz/course-work/swen303/2020/project1/t16/swen303-project/-/blob/master/Personas/Disengaged_Student.pdf)
* [Lecturer - Daniel](https://gitlab.ecs.vuw.ac.nz/course-work/swen303/2020/project1/t16/swen303-project/-/blob/master/Personas/Lecturer.pdf)
* [Tutor - Veronica](https://gitlab.ecs.vuw.ac.nz/course-work/swen303/2020/project1/t16/swen303-project/-/blob/master/Personas/Tutor.pdf)


### Merging of personas background 
To begin each group shared their personas and the qualities associated with them. It was identified that each group had similar titles for their personas and these were:
* Course Coordinator 
* Lecturer 
* Tutor
* Engaged student
* Neutral student
* Disengaged student

This was followed by some constructive discussion about the number of personas the group wanted to pursue. It was recognised that the group wanted to focus on the base case personas which minimises the overlap between each persona. A specific example of this is originally there were personas for engaged, neutral and disengaged students, and it was agreed to deselect neutral students because it was difficult to differentiate how a neutral student would use the Peerwise application differently to a disengaged student. The group remained open to creating another persona later in the development of the PeerWise application if was required. The group then decided on the need to identify four persona titles to use during the development stage of the prototype. This process was not as easy as the group expected because individuals had a preference for their own personas, due mainly to them having a deeper understanding of their characteristics. The group ultimately agreed on the following four personas:

* Lecturer 
* Tutor
* Engaged Student
* Disengaged Student

As the group progressed through the project, it was recognised that time was a restraint, and having a completed prototype for testing was identified was determined the priority. To mitigate the time constraint, the group decided it was unnecessary to standardise the look and feel of the personas, as the most important aspects were title and the content, and they could still be used effectively within the development stage of the prototype. There was a significant amount of commonality within the detail of the personas relating to attitude, aptitude, motivation and skills, which led to the group reaching agreement on the persona detail relatively quickly.

##### How we merged our use-cases
First, we assigned every team member to read their own and all other team members use-cases, to select the most important ones which they should then put in
their own document. We created an issue for this in Gitlab and all team members were assigned to it. Then in our next Zoom meeting we went over each others
documents, comparing them and looking for similarities. In our final selection of use-cases we included every use-case that was in more than one document
and we included some use-cases that was only in one document if we agreed that they were important (e.g. Edit Course was only in Ahad and George use-cases 
document).

Merging personas assigned to use-cases:
After determining our final use-cases we had to merge the roles assigned for these use-cases since we had different roles for the same use-case. For 
example, I assigned only students to create, edit and view questions/quizzes but Justina and Daniel also assigned instructors (lecturers) to this. We discussed and
resolved every role conflict our use-cases had resulting in a final list of use-cases with personas/roles associated with each one.

Merging use-case rankings:
Finally, we had to merge the use-case rankings. Only Justina and Daniel's most important use-cases document was ranked so for myself and (Ahad and George's)
most important use-cases I obtained the ranking of them from our assignment documents. I then averaged all our rankings for each use-case and sorted the 
use-cases from highest average ranking to lowest average ranking. How I calculated the rankings can be seen below

**Ranking calculations:**

Create Question/Quiz (August: (1 - (3/14)) (78.6%), Ahad and George (1 - (4/7)) (42.86%), Justina and Daniel (1 - (1/5)) (80%) Average 67.2%)

Answer Question/Quiz (August: (1- (4/14)) (71.4%), Ahad and George (1 - (5/7)) (28.6%), Justina and Daniel (1 - (0/5)) (100%), Average 66.7%)

View Question/Quizzes (August: N/A, Ahad and George (1 - (6/7)) (14.29%), Justina and Daniel N/A, Average 14.29%)

Login (August: N/A, Ahad and George (1 - (1/7)) (85.72%), Justina and Daniel (1 - (4/5)) (20%), Average 52.86%)

## Part 4: Design ideation



## Part 5: Design review



## Part 6: Prototype




## Part 7: Video



## Part 8: Group reflection
The merging of designs was actually quite a (comparatively) smooth transition. This was likely due to the way we had approached this situation. While we definitely carried out some 'mistakes’ in trying to merge our designs, it wasn’t anything too significant, and our team was still able to function quite efficiently regardless.

We have listed below the steps that we carried out to merge our designs, a description of what was done at each step, and a reflection on how effective each step was. 

Steps:

| Step and Title | Description of what we did | Reflection |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| 1. Review our own and each other's designs | The first thing that we did was to review our own, and our teammates' designs. In this step, we gave each other access to our designs and (separately) wrote down the top three things that we thought were really good about the design, and three things that we thought weren't very good about the design.  | This was an incredibly good step to carry out. If we were to do this assignment again, we would most definitely start with this step. By carrying out this step, we were able to fully understand what each person liked and disliked about our designs, and therefore it was an incredibly good starting point to help us start planning what we wanted our combined design to look like.    |
| 2. Give feedback and discuss the main points of design | In this step, we had a zoom call where we elaborated each point that we wrote down regarding what we liked and disliked about each other's design. This allowed us to clarify any misunderstandings that we had, and also allowed us to properly voice what we liked and what didn't like.  | This was also an incredibly important step in our process. By having this process, it allowed each other to discuss, question and understand why we made certain design choices, why we liked / didn't like certain aspects of each other's design etc.  In this step, it allowed us to understand each other a bit more, and fully appreciate why certain design choices were made. |
| 3. Combine what we wanted / didn’t want in the app | This step was just an extension of the previous step. Here, we combined our thoughts, and tried to narrow down what we wanted in the app. | This step was actually much harder than we had originally thought, mostly due to the fact that each of us had already created a template app which was completely based on what we wanted so our thoughts were already quite solidly formed. However, just like the previous steps that we had, this step was incredibly important as it allowed us to all be aligned and be on the same page as each other. If this step hadn’t been carried out, it could have resulted in some big disagreements later on in this project (or in the next parts) as everyone would still be wanting different things. |
| 4. Start designing our app again| At this stage we started to design our app together. We started on a template, and started writing down the potential pages that we might have on the app. | This step was a bit of a mistake. Since we had just all agreed on what we wanted to do (in the previous step) we had gotten too carried away, and had just ploughed straight into redesigning our app. However, we hadn’t given any thought to the personas that we might use or the use cases that we might have. Therefore we had very little idea about what our _potential users_ would want. Our design was completely ‘designer focused’. (i.e. we had designed it for ourselves, and not for our users). 
If we were to do the assignment again, we would not have carried out this step  / we would have carried out this step later on in the project, after we had made the use cases / personas.|
| 5. Discuss our personas and use cases | Here, we discussed the potential personas and use cases. _Please read the  part 3: how we merged our use cases part for more detail_| This step was also incredibly important. In the previous step we hadn’t thought about / confirmed our use cases and personas, and therefore we started to lose track of what we wanted as a group, for our potential users. This step reconfirmed what we wanted, and helped us get back on track in starting to design a good app. This step was, and is, incredibly important in ensuring that the design choices that we make, are for the user, and not because we ‘feel-like’ putting something in. |
| 6. Revaluate our design choices | Due to the fact that we hadn’t thought about the personas previously, we had to rethink our choices that we had made in step 3. We looked at each of our design choices that we made, and made sure that each of them served a function. e.g. colour choices, menus, functions etc. We also realised at this point that we wanted to follow Google’s design layout - material design. This choice was made so that we would have consistency throughout each page.

In the end we ended up cutting some decisions that we had previously wanted to make on our design as it didn’t contribute anything for the user.  | This was a good step to have. Ideally, this step would have been earlier on, maybe about step 3 (after making personas and use cases).
If this step, and step 6 were done earlier, it would mean that we would have had an easier time combining our thoughts together and deciding what design choices we wanted to do. This is because, after we carried out this step, we realised that many of the original choices that we had made in step 2 were now redundant as those choices were made for us, and provided nothing additional for the user. |
|7. Started the template again | Here we started the design template again. From here on, it was rather smooth running.|


One piece of design that we didn’t include was the logo. We all agreed that although we needed a logo, with the time frame that we were given, there wasn’t enough time to create a good logo using a good design development process in addition to everything else we needed to do for the project. We realised that the logo was an incredibly important part of the design process, and as it represents the app and is one of the key identifying features that people will use to identify the app by, it would be a rash decision to not properly develop the logo. If we were to do this part of the project again (and were given more time), we definitely would have created and developed a logo during this first part of the project. 



**Pros**
<br>
Roleplaying
<br>
Going through the program has shown that we have thought out the design for each persona.
<br>
Roleplaying as Sally showed the strength of our design for someone that will spend a long time using the app. Going through each section of the page requires minimal clicks. We know that Sally will be using all areas of the site throughout her studies therefore it is also crucial that we have a home button at the top of every page so that no matter which page she is on, she can quickly return to the homepage. This means that the highest number of clicks to get from one page to ANY other page is 4 clicks, this is a huge positive for workflow as it doesn't matter where you are.
<br>
Roleplaying as Liam shows the strength of our breadcrumb menu system. For Liam he won't use many of the app's features as he will not be engaged until the final moments of the course, therefore we need it to be clear and easy to get to where he wants and provide the necessary information with minimal effort. Our homepage does this by clearly dividing the website into 4 sections, once in each section you only see the information related to that section, this is important for Liam as he only wants to answer quizzes and doesn't need the rest.
<br>
Roleplaying as the lecturer also showed how our design only shows you the information you need at one time. When enrolling students everything else goes dark and an overlay is displayed, for busy lecturers this is important as they need to spend the minimal time as possible due to their busy schedules.
<br><br>
Control
<br>
Exits are clearly marked. Using industry standards and following Google's material design helps to create an easily understandable and clear app.
<br>
Our use of buttons support this, all submission buttons are in blue, therefore you know that pressing one of these buttons will take you somewhere different, this includes things like enrolling students, submitting quizzes, creating quizzes, editing or deleting quizzes. All of these things are permanent changes and therefore it was important to make it clear that once clicked you will be changing something, this is also supported through the text on the buttons, we use words such as ADD, POST, RETURN, CREATE etc. These are all verbs which show that this button are actions.
<br><br>
Consistency
<br>
By following a design language and staying consistent with that language we can be confident that our program follows this principal. As previously mentioned, we thought about buttons, colours and shapes so that no matter where you are in the app it remains visually consistent. This also applies to the mobile and desktop apps, when swapping between them they are slightly different but the language remains the same, therefore working cross platform is easier.
<br><br>
Preventing Errors
<br>
As discussed above, we remove errors by keeping things such as buttons consistent. This reduces errors as you know what will happen for example a blue button signifies change.
<br><br>
Minimal Design
<br>
We used minimal colours so that it wasn't overwhelming, while also being appropriate for the age group that we were aiming for. We also used the colour white as much as possible to help with clarity, this helped to contrast the text while also drawing your eye (using specific colours) to the important information.
<br><br>
Shortcuts
<br>
The breadcrumb system as previously discussed helps with this. The app has a low barrier to entry as you know that you can backtrack from anywhere and return to the homepage, this means that the app is quick to master which allows for quick traversals across the site.

**Cons**
Shortcuts
<br>
We don't implement specific macros that complete many tasks at once. This is a design choice as we felt it was more important to lower the barrier to entry for people who first view the site then it was to develop complicated shortcuts for heavy users. We feel that heavy users will not be too strongly impacted as there are a limited number of clicks to move through the website.
