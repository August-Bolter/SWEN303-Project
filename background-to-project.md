#### Task:

Background to the project. This should be very similar/identical to at least one of the previous projects background. It could be updated if you want but does not need to be.

- more student focussed because 

### Actual content:

Existing Solution
Peerwise is an online learning tool created by Auckland University. It is used in addition to classes and tutorials to help further a student’s understanding of specific course content with minimal lecturer input. 
<br>

At the start of the college term or university trimester, an empty repository is created by the course coordinator. Students can then create questions, answer questions, rate questions and further discuss them.
<br>

While Peerwise has received a lot of positive user feedback, specifically relating to the opportunity to interact and engage with course material. The users also describe the _UI_ as underwhelming, boring and 'discouraging' due to the lacklustre appearance. Many students have stated how this unintuitive UI, has caused them to be less interested in using the app, and/has stopped them from using the app altogether.
<br>

Below, we have identified and listed the three main objectives of Peerise:
1. Enable students to clarify their understanding and support their learning of each course / paper
2. Engage students with course content during trimesters
3. Allow students to learn by independently

However, keeping in mind the objectives listed above, there are also issues which we have found with the Peerwise application. The top three issues have been listed below: 
1. The app is boring and outdated - the 'vibe' that it maintains is incredibly off-putting
2. The app is unituitive and can be hard / finicky to use
3.

The combination of the top three issues we have listed with the project is incredibly problematic. This is due to the fact that this combination causes the app to be unusable / the user to not want to use it, and that defeats the very purpose of the app in the first place.

#### Existing Solutions 
There are a number of systems that are similar to PeerWise such as Kahootz, GoSoapBox, and Wooclap. 
<br>

All these services have a large sign up/sign in banner at the top of their home page so that it’s the first thing that you see when you first visit the website. Below this they show people that have used their service. Each persons’ demographics and occupation are shown as well therefore, people visiting the website find it easier to identify whether they would use it since they can see if they are similar to the userbase. There are also quotes from these users explaining their positive experiences with it. This means visitors of the site will be more likely to use it. 
<br>

These services are similar to PeerWise because each one is catered for students and teachers. They all innovate traditional learning and make learning more interactive and fun for the students. They also have a much more streamlined registration page and have a tutorial on how to sign up. For example, GoSoapBox and Kahoot has a guide on how to get started right after signing up while PeerWise doesn’t. Each service also has a quicker way to register because the username, password and email fields are all on the same page. In comparison to PeerWise where you need to enter your school/institution, click on the register link and then the fields for each registration detail (username, password, course ID and identifier) are shown on separate pages. In particular, the most inconvenient aspect about PeerWise’s registration is that you can only find out your course ID and identifier from your course coordinator. 
<br>

These services also follow a minimalist design, reducing the amount of text shown on the screen to make sure the user is not overwhelmed with information. And each given text is isolated from other nearby text via a border or container which helps the user to take the information in at a good pace. This is shown in Kahoot’s home page after you login. These services also are more preferable to PeerWise in terms of creating a question or quiz. Take Wooclap for example, their way of creating questions and quizzes gives the user more freedom to customize questions and quizzes since they can have more multiple choice answers than PeerWise which only has 5 at a maximum. Wooclap, unlike PeerWise, allows questions to be in different formats such as polls, open questions, fill in the blank questions etc. These formats are presented in a drop-down list making it convenient for the user to change the format of their question.

#### Business Objectives
PeerWise is a tool instructors (secondary school teachers or university course coordinators) use to set up courses which students can join. Students can then create questions which other students can answer. Additionally, students can rate questions once they have answered them and can filter questions by their topic. They can also start quizzes which are an assortment of questions they have already answered. All these features contribute to PeerWise’s purpose which is to encourage student collaborative learning to ensure that the students have a deeper understanding of the course material

<br>
We have identified many issues with the PeerWise app. However, we have selected the most-pressing concerns and listed them below:
#REVIEW THIS
1. Peerwise has an outdated and inconvenient interface. It is not user-centric for the modern day student 
2. The registration process is long and convoluted
3. -----

<br>
To solve this issue a modernised interface and design is needed. Having this will make it easier for students to use PeerWise and they will be more incentivised to continue using it in the future. They will also be more likely to recommend it to family and friends. This will lead to a larger user-base that has more returning users (users that revisit PeerWise). It will also help with the key business objectives of PeerWise (listed below):
- Instructors can facilitate collaborative student learning through course creation and activation
- Students can have a deeper understanding of topics by explaining and discussing questions and their answers
- PeerWise has an easy-to-use, convenient and modernised interface and has an aesthetically pleasing design

#### Importance to StakeHolders
PeerWise is important as it gives students another way to learn course material. If students keep learning in the same way they are more likely to become demotivated and unenthusiastic about learning so they will find it harder to take in course material. This might lead them to submitting lower quality assignments/projects and/or performing worse in exams. PeerWise is also important because it allows students to learn from each other and they can give each other different views and opinions on topics which they may not have thought about. This results in a much deeper understanding of the topic.<br>
PeerWise also helps teachers because it ensures that students aren’t relying solo on the teachers perspective of the topic. Having only one perspective of the topic can potentially create biases and can limit how well students can comprehend the material. This in turn may affect the students grades therefore it should be avoided. <br>
This also alleviates some of the teachers and professors workload by getting the students to help each other on topics that they are confused about, and the teacher won’t need to spend their time helping each troubled student individually. This means that teachers will be able to teach more topics to the students and/or dive deeper into the topics they are already teaching. <br>

### Business Objectives:
As mentioned above, we have identified three major issues with the current learning management systems. We believe that our app will address these issues and therefore it will make learning at university an incredibly fun, interesting and exciting experience. Which is why our app is so valuable. 

As students of the 21st century, we are becoming an increasingly diverse range of people. We now understand that there are an incredibly wide range of people, all with different learning abilities, and recognise that education should be accessible for everyone. The main issue with the current education system is that the way it is designed, it is only suited for a very specific, and minority group of people’s learning styles. Our learning system is designed to help students who may have different learning types to the one that we are used to teaching in schools. Our new, updated learning management system has been designed to help the course content be more accessible and understandable for the students. Therefore, it is obvious that our system’s main objectives is to create:

#### remake this list with group / check what they want aagin 
1. An easily navigable system that is intuitive to use
2. As a result, this app should support students to help pass their exams, and understand the course content better
3. Provide a system which the students can interact with each other as well as the teacher, and provide statistics to both the teacher and students in the class to understand how well the rest of the class is doing 
4. The app is designed to create a judge-free zone, allowing students to efficiently give feedback to the lecturers and increase the level constructive dialogue to lecturers
 
Justification for the main core functions
Our learning management system is supposed to be designed in such a way that is easy and accessible for everyone. While it is easy to assume that the large majority of students are used to technology and the basic, common layout for most apps, it is also important there are also a number of postgraduate, mature students as well as lecturers who may not necessarily be used to technology. Therefore it should be intuitive to use, even for people who aren’t used to technology. 

The learning management system is supposed to be a way to communicate the information to student(s) clearly, and concisely, removing all the excess, unneeded information. This is to cater to all students, especially those who are often confused by all the jargon that is used in lectures.

Many students are afraid to ask the lecturer questions during and after lectures or during office hours as they are afraid of being laughed at. This application will help reduce that anxiety for students as they can either directly ask the lecturer about the course without needing to see them face-to-face or post on the board where they aren’t physically confronted by the other students or lecturer.
