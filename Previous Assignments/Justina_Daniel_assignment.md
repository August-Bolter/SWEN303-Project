# Part 2: Design Coverage:

### Information Architecture:

The way that we organised our information was through a combination of _hierarchical and sequential_. 
Originally, we used a very crude form of the matrix structure. As we thought that by letting the user type in what they wanted into a search bar etc. was a good idea. However, after interviewing some potential users, we discovered that aprroximately 2% of the users thought that this was a "cool idea", the remaining 98% hated it, and struggled to understand the possible actions the app could preform. This type of organisation was too gimicky and would make people who aren't used to / proficient in, using technology struggle. Also people would have to be familiar with what our app does to be able to know what functions they wanted and so it wouldn't be very pratical for our [Liam Rolleston](https://gitlab.ecs.vuw.ac.nz/kohjust/swen303-assignment-1/-/blob/master/Resources/liam-rollestion.pdf)
persona as he is someone who wants to use the a specific function in the app quickly. 

In the end, we organised our information like a tree: <br>
*[Heirarchy of information](https://gitlab.ecs.vuw.ac.nz/kohjust/swen303-assignment-2/-/blob/master/resources/flow-diagram.pdf)

This means that all users would be able to easily access the pages that they want to. Listed below are the personas and what pages they are most likely to use. These are also listed in the order of importance i.e. who will use the app the most.

### Colour palette:

**Colour palette**: https://coolors.co/ff8300-fe1d1b-640372-26a9c9-ffffff<br>
**Palette for those with Deuteranomaly** (red-green colour-blindness): https://coolors.co/d0d927-a9ba1b-3f4650-574dbf-ffffff <br><br>
*Other steps have been taken to ensure that those who are (mildly) visually impaired are able to use the app. Please refer to the font chosen and size used section.*

The colour palette was chosen due to the following reasons:
1. The colour palette has an appropriate range of colours; they are bright and colourful
2. There are five colours in the palette

The justifications behind each choice is as follows: <br>
*1. Justification for having a range of colours*
It is well known, and proven, that different colours will have a different effect on our mood. In the 21st century, we have a very fixed opinion on what emotions are associated with what colours. Our colour palette consists of five colours: _white, blue, purple, red and amber (orange)_. Each of the following colours have the corresponding emotion associations: white - purity and innocence, blue - calmness, red - excitement, orange - enthusiasm and attention and purple - importance and strength(1).

**Blue** 
was chosen to help 'calm-down' the page so that the user wouldn't be overloaded with bright colours. Blue has many associatiations with social media websites including Twitter and Facebook, this helps to create an association to messages and contacting people. This helps to decrease the mental load in connecting seeing blue to sending feedback. Stressed students who are last minute cramming such as Liam, will be desperate to reach the lecturer and get crucial last minute information off them, therefore we knew using red or orange would be the wrong colours to use.

**Red**
was chosen in order to grab the user's attention and make the page more exciting and interesting. It is also meant to help increase people's ability to retain information(4). Red is a colour of passion and courage, this colour can be used to make people excited and interested in doing the quizzes. Quizzes are aimed to be more fast-paced learning that breaks the information down into smaller chunks to help learning, therefore we felt red is the best colour to accomplish this. Red is associated with things like health, blood, fire and heat, which we feel help to increase the users heart rate and engage them with the quiz.

**Orange**
is an energitic colour but not as aggressive as red. Which makes it a good colour for studying. Users will spend more time on fewer pages in the study section as the purpose of the study section is to learn the content. Some of the activities people will be doing include reading, writing, discussing and reviewing the content on the pages. This means that the colour should be something that is not bland but also not jarring. Orange is a good compromise in this regard. We feel that orange is the perfect fit because it is warm and welcoming, orange can be associated with things like the sun or oranges.

**Purple**
was chosen because it is a colour of nobility and importance, therefore giving an increase to the feeling of depth and meaning to the information. This helps to create an association between purple and comparing answers with friends. We know that comparing answers with friends can be difficult especially with competitive students, therefore purple was picked to be a cooler colour while still having an element of fun. We didn't want to use blue for comparing scores as we felt it may wash out and not give enough respect to the time spent on their studies, we knew this would be important to people like Sally who can be prideful in their work. For someone like Makayla purple was also good as she would spend large amounts of her time in this seciton, comparing answers with friends, therefore the colour should still be an interesting colour.

**White**
was the main colour in our site because it is the perfect colour to contrast the rest. It should be used to help readability and is the best colour to enhance the rest. We understood that even though colour was a crucial component was it was vital to be used sparingly so that the most important part of the website was able to be accessed. The most important piece of the website is the words on the page and therefore if reading text isn't givent the highest priority then the website will become a burden to use, therefore it was vital make sure important text was not obfuscated. White was the best colour to use for that. <br>

For us it was incredibly important in making sure that we had a balance between the 'exciting' attention-grabbing colours and the calm, soothing colours. Having too much / solely the exciting colours would create a sense of anxiety and urgency in the students (3) and having too much / solely the calming soothing colours would put people to sleep or bore them (3). 

Therefore we made the decision to have two 'exciting' colours and two 'calming' colours as well as white as it is important for contrast and space.

*2. There are five colours in the palette*
We decided to only have five different colours in the palette. This was primarily due to the reason that while it has been proven that the use of colours do help people retain information better, conversely, the overuse of colours can also overload people with information and cause the opposite effect(1). By limiting ourselves to five different colours, it allows diversity in the range of colours and therefore prevents it from becoming boring, but at the same time, prevent the pages from being cluttered, overworked and distracting from the main purpose of the website - to help students learn.

### Font chosen and size used:
In order to cater for people with learning difficulties and are only partially visuall impaired, we did some research into which fonts are better for those with dyslexia an dyspraxia. In the end we used Verdana, a font that is 'fat' enough so that those who are mildly visually impaired and/or have dsylexia/dypraxia should be able to read. Additionally, we made sure that our font was reasonably large - no smaller than size 15(1). We also minimised the use of underlined and bold words to help increase the clarity of the words as this can make it more difficult for those with dyslexia to read(2).

### Logo:
The top three points that were priority for us in the creation of our logo were:
1. Simplicity and minimalism
2. Must convey the main idea behind the application. 

The justifications for the choices are as follows:
1. Simplicity and minimalism
One of the most common downfalls with logo creation, is to try put too much into it once - having "to much icing and not enough cake(1). By adding too many elements into the logo, it will have embellishments while not having enough meaning to symbolise what the application is about, and users won't be able to understand what the application is about reading more about it. Therefore, we want to minimise the amount of "icing" we have on our logo to only what is absolutely necessary, and only to the things that will help increase the meaningfulness of the logo. 

(1) https://www.designmantic.com/blog/overdoing-logo-design/  <br>

2. Must convey the main idea behind the appplication
This is very closely related to the first idea. We believe that a fundamental sign of a good logo is that you're able to get a basic understanding of what the _website_ is supposed to do from the logo alone and no other information(1). 

(1) https://www.wix.com/blog/2018/07/good-logo-design-tips/  <br>

Explanation behind the logo:
The logo can be broken down into 5 main elements:
1. A coloured owl <br>
- An owl was used to represent the educational aspect of the website. Owls are very closely associated with intellect and education, and therefore it will communicate a very clear message to _any person_ who sees the logo that this is an educaational app. 
- The colours used to colour the owl was chosen in our colour palette. Therefore the choice of colours is the same as why we chose the colours in the palette.

### Storyboard:
  1. The app should be easy and intuitive to navigate
  2. The icons should be clear enough that _most_ _people_ would be able to understand them without words or a user manual
  3. The app should be clean and be minimalist (have only what is needed on the screen)
  4. The app should be bright and colourful

#### Explanation to each point:
1. The basic functions of the app should be intuitive enough for people to be able to use without needing an instruction manual or tutorial being provided. We will however, provide a help button so that those who wish to can investigate further and receive help if necessary. However, we are desgining our app in such a way that this tutorial will not be necessary. From the interviews that we did with multiple students from Victoria Unversity, we discovered that the majority of students don't want a complicated study app with many features. They would much prefer something that is very easy to use so that they don't have to waste time that thye could spend learning content on learning how to use the application. _something about the way navagation_
2. The same sort of logic from above applies to this point. Icons should be clear and obviuos as to what they are so that students don't have to waste time clicking around to figure out what each one does.
3. Only what is _needed_ by the user should be shown on the page. This is an incredibly important factor for many reasons. Firsly, while there are many studies that show colours and having different _images etc_ help improve the ability for someone to remember and retain information, conversely, newer studies show that havig _too much_ in a classroom or more importantly notes and a page is counterproductive and detrimental to a person's ability to focus(5).  
4. We want to utilise colours in the most effective way. Studies have shown that colours are essential to the development of cognitive motor skills of children(1) and later on in life, they are incredibly effective in helping _all_ people when learning(2). This is why many common, important things like traffic lights and warning signs are different colours(3) - to bring attention to the object and make sure that we *remember* it. We want this sort of _knowledge_ be applied to our app so that people are learning without _actively trying_ to learn. However, it is incredibly important to make sure that we dont _overuse_ colours in th app as this can be counterintuitive to the process of learning and instead bombard the user with information instead and hinder their learning(4). 
--> The combination of both points four and five emphasise the importance having effectively minimalist content. We should have bright colours and quirky diagrams to help people remember things, but only in moderation.

### Designed Pages:
#### General

For each of the screens where white was used as a background with the hardware pattern the reasoning behind this choice was: 
- The hard pattern was selected as it added some more 'pzazz' to the screen without overcluttering it as the pattern isn't very busy. 
- The white was used as it is a 'neutral' and clean colour (1) which would also help prevent the screen from becoming overly cluttered with colours or desgins.
- White also wakes up the user(2) and prevents them from sleeping - an issue that many people may struggle with when studying for 'boring' topics or topics that they aren't interested in.  
- This background was used repeatedly in each of the screens (except the login screen) as this would maintain a sense of continuity.

(2) https://www.bbc.com/news/health-50807011  <br>

Buttons: We used buttons in both the website and the app. Each of the buttons that we put in had:
- Firstly, we wanted the way that you interacted with the app and webpage be as similar to each other as possible so that users have the ability to change between the two choices without much confusion as how to operate the app. 
- Secondly, after doing some user testing, we discovered that having the green study button there was intuitive to non-experienced web/app users. We found that people who were less experienced with using apps and websites struggled to understand the concept of double clicking on a course option to continue to the next page, but were able to get onto the study page easily when we put in the study button.
- We also used clear verbs on them so that it was obvious as to what the buttons would do i.e. finish the quiz or edit a page etc. 
- Were bright to draw the user's attention to the buttons as they are necessary to execute functions like to start a quiz or to submit feedback

#### List of pages and description:
**1. Login Screen:** _this is the login screen where users have the ability to log into their account_ <br>

The decision here was to limit the amount of colours, option, text and all other things such as pictures etc. on the page. This is as, this is the first page that the user will see after picking the app, and to us it was very important to maintain the aura of 'studiosity' (an aura of education and studying). The login screen is incredibly important in trying to draw the user in, and help the user establish exactly what the app is used for, and it has been found that using too many words, or too much stimuli can scare the user and make them less likely to continue using the app(1). Additionally, we had created a series of login screens and had sent out a survey to some of our friends to see which one they prefered and why, and their logic was very much the same as ours - they preferred the page with fewer elements in it and the general consensus was that it was less intimidating and clear as to what the app was supposed to do, particularly compared to the pages that we created which had lots of cute pictures and animations on them. 
We also wanted to ensure that we kept consistency across the program, being the login page we felt it was important to set the stage for the 4 defining colours as they will remain the same throughout the site. 
We used this feedback from our friends to help establish the rest of the pages as well.

**2. Home Page:** _This screen is the main home-screen. It has all the possible options available here_ <br>

This screen only has five main elements on it: 4 icons for each of the possible options  and the menu bar at the top of the page. Each of the possible options were given a specific colour that each option, and it's children would be associated with. This is as we wanted to maintain a sense of continuity and use colour association for the user to _understand fill in here_.

**3. Study Page:**  _This is the parent node for all the study related options. This page lists all the possible courses that the user can click on and read lecture content about. First the user must click the course they want to study, then the study button._

The choice of having the user needing to click on the course they want to study, and then the green study button was a deliberate one. Please refer to the 'buttons' section for more information.  

**3.1. Read/study content screen:** _This page appears after selecting which course you want to study. This contains information that the lecturer will write about the lectures(s). One this page, all you need to do is scroll up and down the page. When you have finished studying, you click the finished button._

We put in the 'finished' button for the same reason we put in the study button in the previous page. 

**4. Quiz Page:** _This page contains the list of possible quizzes that you have. A tick will appear next to the quizzes that you have completed and a cross for ones that you have not completed._

The 'start quiz' button was put in for the same reason as the pages above. 

The choice of having a cross / tick in addition to having the box highlighted in red / green depending if you've done the quiz or not was done as from the user testing we carried out, people often forgot what quizzes and lectures that they had already studied. By having the colour and the symbol to show what they had already completed made it easier for people to keep track of what they had done. 

We also found that due to our preference for clarity over information density, we realised it was crucial to have ways to filter and find the quizzes you were searching for as quickly as possible, this led to us putting in a search bar and methods for sorting the quizzes.

**5. Compare Page**
This page was designed to be a simple way to compare with friends. We know that it is important for our users to be able to view each other's learning and use it to talk and improve their own knowledge, in the app they can see which areas their friends excel at and where they are struggling. This is useful for people such as Mikayla who work together with friends to study as they can easily help each other where needed.

**6. Feedback / Verify Page**
Feedback is a crucial tool for students to have a direct line of communication with their lecturer. It is faster to have a way to message the lecturer and request further information on topics or ask for help on topics they struggle with. It is faster and easier to have an in-app solution rather than relying on email which may be difficult for the lecturer to respond to due to the large number of emails they are sent. Therefore it was important for this section to be very simple and clear allowing for simple communication to be sent.

# Reflection
### Justina's reflection

Logo:
By the time we were designing the logo, we had already eastablished the basics of app, such as the colour palette to be used. This definitely streamlined the process of developing the logo. The decision of keeping the same colour palette in the logo as the app was a rather natural one. The logo should encapsulate the essence of the app and have strong connections to what the app is supposed to do, and therefore by using the same colour palette it would maintain that.

Firstly, we wanted our text (name of the app), 'Peerwise' to stand out. When people see a logo for an app, it should be clear what the logo is for, and by making the name of the app stand out, it will help people develop a clear association between our logo and our app therefore the choice of putting the Peerwise name in white was made. 

The decision of using an owl on the other hand was not as easy. Originally, we wanted to use an elephant - another animal that represents intellect and education. However, after much discussion and interviewing a range of university students whether an elephant or owl was more appropriate for our app, we decided that the owl would be more suitable. Firstly, it had a graduation cap on, and secondly while we thought that the elephant was a more obvious choice of an illectual animal, it was found that almost all the students we interviewed put Owls in that spot. Therefore we eneded up using the owl not and elephant.

Storyboard and page layout:

While we originally had a very clear idea of what we wanted for the app/website after we carried out the user testing, we discovered that it was not good enough. Please read the following table for more information.

| Steps we did | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| 1. Created a basic app/webiste | Originally we created a basic app that we thought was appropriate. This was very, very colourful, had lots of little icons and pictures in the background. We also used our original colour palette (although at this time, we didn't have an official colour palette. We just put in colours that we liked and thought looked nice.) |
| 2. Revised the app. Looked at other professional apps. | We realised that there was an issue with the way we were designing. We were just creating whatever we thought looked nice and the app was the app form of mayhem. There were too many colours and pictures etc. Therefore we did some _market research_ by googling and downloading already available apps and websites and taking note of what we liked about them and what we thought was efefctive about their apps/websites. | 
|3. Created our main storyboard points| These are the points that we thought would be the most important and what we should keep in mind when making the app. We created these points by reviewing the notes we wrote from the previous steps and shortlisted the ones that we thought were the best points. |
|4. Created a proper colour palette| We then created a proper colour palette that we decided was appropriate. We did this by picking colours we liked, doing research behind the psychology of different and then reasoning which colours we should add in  / leave out. |
|5. Sent our survey about the colour palette|After we created the first colour palette, we sent a survey out to our friends. We learnt from the first SWEN303 assignment that we had to eliminate as much bias as posisble by sending the survey out to as many different people as possible, and so a variety of different uni students from different courses were surveyed as well as as non-uni students as well. This survey asked them their opinions on each colour i.e. what mood they associated with each colour.  |
|6. Reviewed and finalised the colour palette| From the results of the survey, we reviewed the colour palette and finalised it. We made sure that there was a balance of colours and their associated moods i.e. there were an equal amount of  'angry / attention grabbing' colours and calming, peaceful colours.|
|7. Started to redesign each page using the colour palette|Here we started to redesign the app from the beginning. We analysed each page and made sure that we were only using colours from the colour palette. Here we decided that in order to maintain a sense of fluidity in the app, we arranged the possible interactions in the app the organisation of the information architecture as a combination of hierarchical and sequential. This decision was made after some more peer interviews (Please read the _Heirarchy of Information_ section to find out more ). We also decided that there would be one colour associated with each of the four possible 'big actions' (i.e. studying, creating, feedback and quiz) and all of its children nodes. |
|8. Sent the page out to friends to review and get their feedback| We sent the page out to make sure the colour palette was acceptable and that there were no obvious qualms with it. After we recevied the feedback, we continued with the next step.|
|9. Created a logo | We created a logo. Originally, we wanted a very sleek and minimalistic logo. However, after we created a very cool logo that was very minimalistic, we realised that it didn't represent what peerwise was about - education. It was just a few lines that looked nice. It also beccome apparent that it was a terrible logo as we showed the logo to a few peers, and asked them what they though the logo represented, to which none of the answers they gave us was remotely correct. Therefore we had to regroup and come up with a better, more representative design and rethink of original choice of having a minimalistic logo.|

#### What have we learnt about the problem?
One of the first things that I learnt was that apps and websites aren’t as easy to make as you think! Despite the final result of our app appearing to be a very simple app with only four different functions, the planning and the amount of processing, researching and user testing that we did was incredible. So much had to be done and constantly redone to help refine the app that we were creating. <br> 

One of the most important things to note was that originally, we thought that we could get away with no user-testing / feedback / interviewing. However, after we (reluctantly) carried out the first user survey, by surveying our friends around us, we realised how helpful it was to get their feedback on choices we made. This was particularly important to us as we didn’t realise that we had formed our own bubble of opinions and needed another perspective to make us realise this. After this, we acknowledged the importance of user testing / feedback, and did this regurarly to get more perspectives on what we should be doing and what choices we made. <br>

Another thing that I learnt was that the organisation of the information is incredibly important! I didn’t realise this for a long time until we made the first draft of the app (look to step 1 of the table / timeline) and surveyed some of our friends about it did we realise that the way that we had originally organised the app made it incredibly hard to use. After this, we revised the layout to make it easier for everyone to use and interviewed more people about it to truly make sure that the layout was good. 

It's incredibly important to really think, and understand what the _users_ want when desigining. Many times in the assignment, we would create something that looked incredibly cool, but after interviewing people, realised was a terrible design choice (i.e. our original logo that was three lines.) In the end many comprimises had to be made in order to facilitate what the uesrs wanted, over what we wanted as they are the most important people when creating something. it doesn't matter how nice you think something is, if the user thinks it is terrible, then no one is going to use it!

If I were to do this assignment again, I would make sure to interview people first to get an idea of what _they_ expect and want from an education app / website and start building on from there. Our method of execution, which was to start desgining for ourselves first, before getting outside input wasted a lot of time and effort as we had to constantly redraw, remake and redesign what we had created. 


| Pros | Cons |
| ------ | ------ |
|- It is obvious what functions that the user can use / what functions the app has   | - There isn’t much variety in what people can do. It would be nice to include a little bit of adjustments that the user could make to suit them personally|
|- From the ‘user testing’, it is obvious that the application / website is easy to use and is very intuitive to use even for those who aren’t as fluent in using websites / apps  |- Our app is great for people who can _see_. In the app, we made specifications that would make it easier for those with learning disabilities and are only mildly visually impaired to use the app. However, we weren’t able to show how we would make the app usable for those who are completely visually impaired (those who are blind etc.) | 
|- All the icons used in the app are universally understood. Therefore it should be very clear as to what has been preformed, what buttons to click etc. |- The app lacks the finesse and level of professionality that you see in well established apps such as facebook or instagram. |
|- It is a simple, no-frills app. This means that the learning curve is very small, and people will be able to use it quickly without needing to have a lot of background knowledge. ||
|- There is a good colour association used. Each parent node i.e. study, quiz, compare and feedback uses their own colour, and all of its children nodes (pages that are generated after clicking on the parent node) uses the same colour as well. ||
|- There is a feedback button so that the lecturer and student can communicate. This should help increase learning||
|- The colours chosen were deliberate, and all chosen to boost people’s ability to learn. Therefore when the students are using the app, the amount of information that they uptake is increased. ||
|- The functions that can be done on the app are limited so that the users don’t get caught up in the design parts of the app than actually learning and studying. ||
|-  Buttons and texts are big and obvious so that it is easier for _all_ people to use ||
|- Buttons use verbs to ensure that the user knows exactly what they are clicking on the button for ||

#### Changes made from original plan:
Luckily for us, there was no major change from the original plan (in terms of the way the app functioned) from our first assignment. While I think part of it was due to good planning, another part was that we had kept the options possible very simple and the biggest part was that we had really thought about our personas i.e. our potential users. We had analysed well a variety of possible students and therefore were able to narrow down ti exactly what we needed in the app, and nothing more. We minimised what we needed to do, and therefore there was a lot less to go wrong and need to change. 


### Daniel's Reflection:

Colour was a major focus for the design and formed the basis for the design. We picked four colours that complemented each other nicely, we also ensured that they were relevant to each section they matched with. The key idea behind this design was that each colour was associated with each section. For most people this gives a very clear and concise way of knowing where you are in the site and what you are able to do there. 

The issue with using colour in such a critical way was that if you are unable to perceive the colour then the website loses its greatest strength. This was something that as we developed our design we came to realise the importance of clarity in the design. This led to the repetition of shapes as well as colours. Buttons, information panels and text boxes all keep to the design language that we created, this was an attempt to mitigate the reliance on colour.

The size and shape of the panels are all quite large for the sake of clarity. This is good for mobile devices that have smaller screens as well as those who may have impaired vision. The trade off for this design is information density and it means that there are a limited number of things we can display at one time, including quizzes and topics. When faced with this problem we realised the usefulness of a search bar where necessary to decrease the amount of tedious scrolling getting to where you want to go.

I felt confused with what was expected with this assignment. I understand that we were only expected to have a final colour page for the homepage and a brief outline of the other pages. But it was difficult to express the correct outline for the pages without just designing them. I think that I spent too much time on small details and should have done less tweaking. I felt this assignment was very easy to overdue the unnecessary details which meant that it took much longer than I had hoped. If I was to do this assignment again I would do much more approximation as I know that is not a finalised design and should be respected as dealing with ideas and overviews rather than specific minuscule detail.

I also spent a large portion of my time learning Adobe XD and I am happy with the experience I now have in using the software. I think that it is a useful skill to have as it could be used in other areas, such as in my personal life, when I wish to design a website for myself. However it was quite a learning curve in understanding the correct way to use the software and this again added to the time my assignment took to complete.

If I was to do another website I would attempt to have another main focus rather than colour, I think this would be an interesting experience to try and create something completely different as it would require a different frame of mind.
