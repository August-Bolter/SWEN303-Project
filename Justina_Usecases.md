# My classification of most important use-cases

we were assigned to rank what we believe are our most important usecases. Please review each pair's assignment that is in the repo and determine what you think the most important usecases are. It would be good if you could write these down, so we all have a record. I have created a .md file in the repo called "Ahad_Usecases.md" as an example. I know we're all busy with SWEN301 but I think this way would be good so we have everyone's input, and we spend less time figuring out what usecases we want in tomorrow's meeting.

Issue here is that we've all implemented it differently. I've made the decision based on what each person's peerwise is like.
