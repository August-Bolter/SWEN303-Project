##### How we merged our use-cases
First, we assigned every team member to read their own and all other team members use-cases, to select the most important ones which they should then put in
their own document. We created an issue for this in Gitlab and all team members were assigned to it. Then in our next Zoom meeting we went over each others
documents, comparing them and looking for similarities. In our final selection of use-cases we included every use-case that was in more than one document
and we included some use-cases that was only in one document if we agreed that they were important (e.g. Edit Course was only in Ahad and George use-cases 
document).

Merging personas assigned to use-cases:
After determining our final use-cases we had to merge the roles assigned for these use-cases since we had different roles for the same use-case. For 
example, I assigned only students to create, edit and view questions but Ahad and George also assigned instructors (lecturers) to this. We discussed and
resolved every role conflict our use-cases had resulting in a final list of use-cases with personas/roles associated with each one.

Merging use-case rankings:
Finally, we had to merge the use-case rankings. Only Justina and Daniel's most important use-cases document was ranked so for myself and (Ahad and George's)
most important use-cases I obtained the ranking of them from our assignment documents. I then averaged all our rankings for each use-case and sorted the 
use-cases from highest average ranking to lowest average ranking. How I calculated the rankings can be seen below
