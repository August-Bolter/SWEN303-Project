# Ahad + George:

## Pros:

**Consistency**, all pages look like they belong to the same website, even when viewing on mobile.

**Recognition**, follows Google's guidelines, so users familiar will Google products will be able to pick up Peerwise.

**Recognition**, Familiar icons and shortcuts which support an intuative feel

**Minimal Design**, only the most important elements are shown to the user. No unnecessary controls that can be interpreted as confusing. Also a careful use of colour, to not overwhelm or distract the user.

**Minimal Design**, Practical layout enables the user to easily intercact with the site, irrespective of the frequency of use  

**Shortcuts**, Enables lecturers to add a CSV file directly to add students rather than adding them all indivually

## Cons:

**Shortcuts**, no shortcuts currently implemented, to do frequent use cases. Have to do everything with mouse and going back to Dashboard

**Help**, There is no guidance for the user upon first use of the application, could look into the idea of having 'text bubbles' popping up on first interaction with system

**Help**, Lacks advanced features such as text reading aloud, which is an important consideration for hearing-impaired students


# Daniel + Justina:

## Pros:

**Consistency**, layout and general design style remains consistent throughout the website.

**Language**, buttons are self-descriptive. I know what I am expecting when clicking a button.


## Cons:
**Control**, didn't know that clicking the owl would go back home. Can't go back a screen. Need to go back to homepage.

**Minimal Design**, I feel like it's just a bit too much colour.

**Consistency**, The design is always intuitive to the creator, however it must always be tested by a sample target audience. An example would be seeing which button people click to ‘Ask a question’.


# August:

## Pros:

**Consistency**, layout and general design style remains consistent throughout the website.

**Control**, navigation bar is always present in every screen. User always has the ability of what they want to do from where they are.

**No/Prevent Errors**, dialog box makes it clear to the user what will happen after the user has made a choice. Buttons are self-descriptive.

## Cons:

**Minimal Design**, I feel like it's just a bit too much colour. Not a huge fan of using blue as background colour.
