# Ahad + George:

## Pros:

**Consistency** 

*  All pages look like they belong to the same website, even when viewing on mobile.
*  The body text has the same font in different pages (font selection is consistent)
*  The mobile design is consistent with the web (non-mobile) design

**Recognition**

*  Follows Google's guidelines, so users familiar will Google products will be able to pick up Peerwise.
*  Familiar icons and shortcuts which support an intuative feel

**Language** 

*  Uses language that matches the user-base (university students and staff) vocabulary (e.g. Course codes)

**Minimalism**

*  Only the most important elements are shown to the user. No unnecessary controls that can be interpreted as confusing. Also a careful use of colour, to not overwhelm or distract the user.
*  Practical layout enables the user to easily intercact with the site, irrespective of the frequency of use

**Status**

*  Shows the user useful status information like how many students are online

**Shortcuts**

*  Enables lecturers to add a CSV file directly to add students rather than adding them all indivually

## Cons:

**Shortcuts**

*  No shortcuts currently implemented, to do frequent use cases. Have to do everything with mouse and going back to Dashboard

**Help**

*  There is no guidance for the user upon first use of the application, could look into the idea of having 'text bubbles' popping up on first interaction with system
*  Lacks advanced features such as text reading aloud, which is an important consideration for hearing-impaired students
*  Lacks a way for users to give feedback to PeerWise

## Pros:

**Consistency**

*  Layout and general design style remains consistent throughout the website.
*  A bright consistent colour scheme is used throughout the website
*  A bright consistent colour scheme is used throughout the website
*  The body text has the same font in different pages (font selection is consistent)
*  The mobile app design is consistent with the website design. This allows for easy switching between the two interfaces.

**Language**
*  Uses language that matches the user-base (university students and staff) vocabulary (e.g. Course codes)
*  Buttons are self-descriptive. I know what I am expecting when clicking a button.

**Recognition**
*  Text hyperlinks are underlined and blue which is the standard style for hyperlinks meaning it is easy for users to recognise that the text is a hyperlink.
*  Icons used are very ‘typical’ and are icones that there is a global understanding of what they mean. 

**Help**
*  A colour blind mode is available, so the design accounts for colour blind people
*  The buttons and layout of the app is very clear and obvious. This means that the app is very intuitive to us and no explanation is needed
*  Students can give feedback to the lecturer

**Status**
*  Tells the user what courses they are in via a dropdown menu

**Error Prevention** 
*  The app has been made in such a simple way that there is no need for error prevention messages. 


## Cons:

**Control**

*  Didn't know that clicking the owl would go back home. Can't go back a screen. Need to go back to homepage.

**Minimalism**

*  I feel like it's just a bit too much colour.
*  Not enough space between components on the web page, this results in the components looking a bit cramped up
*  There is a tiny bit too much colour which can detract away from the overall effectiveness of the design.
*  Not enough space between components on the web page, this results in the components looking a bit cramped up

**Consistency**
*  The design is always intuitive to the creator, however it must always be tested by a sample target audience. An example would be seeing which button people click to ‘Ask a question’.

**Status**
*  Lacks status updates such as the popups when user is hovering over options. 

**Shortcuts**
*  No shortcuts currently implemented, to do frequent use cases. Have to do everything with mouse and going back to Dashboard


# August:

## Pros:

**Consistency**

*  Layout and general design style remains consistent throughout the website.

**Recognition**

*  Uses a footer to include facebook, instagram and twitter pages. Other project didn't consider this aspect 

**Control**

*  Navigation bar is always present in every screen. User always has the ability of what they want to do from where they are.

**No errors**

*  Dialog box makes it clear to the user what will happen after the user has made a choice. Buttons are self-descriptive.
*  A confirmation dialogue appears when the user chooses to edit or delete their question, this ensures that the user doesn’t accidentally edit/delete the question.

**Minimalism**

*  Guidelines about creating questions are shown in a separate window, to reduce the amount of text on screen for the creating a question page

**Status**

*  When the user hovers over a row in the table it darkens

**Shortcuts**

*  The navigation bar allows the user to jump to different pages of the website

**Help**

*  Users can give feedback to PeerWise via a feedback form

## Cons:

**Consistency**

*  Main background colour for webpages is not consistent, i.e. dark grey, dark blue and light blue are all background colours.

**Minimalism**

*  I feel like it's just a bit too much colour. Not a huge fan of using blue as background colour.
*  Some areas are over crowded with text

**Status**

*  Lacks status ideas such as loading and progression bars, however this is a mockup design and doesn't implement all 'active' features
