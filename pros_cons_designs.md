# Ahad + George:

## Pros:

**Consistency**, all pages look like they belong to the same website, even when viewing on mobile.

**Consistency**, the body text has the same font in different pages (font selection is consistent)

**Consistency** The mobile design is consistent with the non-mobile design

**Recognition**, follows Google's guidelines, so users familiar will Google products will be able to pick up Peerwise.

**Recognition**, Familiar icons and shortcuts which support an intuative feel

**Language**, uses language that matches the user-base (university students and staff) vocabulary (e.g. Course codes)

**Minimal Design**, only the most important elements are shown to the user. No unnecessary controls that can be interpreted as confusing. Also a careful use of colour, to not overwhelm or distract the user.

**Minimal Design**, Practical layout enables the user to easily intercact with the site, irrespective of the frequency of use  

**Status**, shows the user useful status information like how many students are online

**Shortcuts**, Enables lecturers to add a CSV file directly to add students rather than adding them all indivually

## Cons:

**Shortcuts**, no shortcuts currently implemented, to do frequent use cases. Have to do everything with mouse and going back to Dashboard

**Help**, There is no guidance for the user upon first use of the application, could look into the idea of having 'text bubbles' popping up on first interaction with system

**Help**, Lacks advanced features such as text reading aloud, which is an important consideration for hearing-impaired students

**Help**, Lacks a way for users to give feedback to PeerWise


# Daniel + Justina:

## Pros:

**Consistency**, layout and general design style remains consistent throughout the website.

**Consistency**, a bright consistent colour scheme is used throughout the website

**Recognition**, text hyperlinks are underlined and blue which is the standard style for hyperlinks meaning it is easy for users to recognise that the text is a hyperlink.

**Help**, a colour blind mode is available, so the design accounts for colour blind people

**Help**, students can give feedback to the lecturer

**Status**, tells the user what courses they are in via a dropdown menu

**Language**, buttons are self-descriptive. I know what I am expecting when clicking a button.


## Cons:
**Control**, didn't know that clicking the owl would go back home. Can't go back a screen. Need to go back to homepage.

**Minimal Design**, I feel like it's just a bit too much colour.

**Minimalism**, not enough space between components on the web page, this results in the components looking a bit cramped up

**Consistency**, The design is always intuitive to the creator, however it must always be tested by a sample target audience. An example would be seeing which button people click to ‘Ask a question’.


# August:

## Pros:
**Recognition**, uses a footer to include facebook, instagram and twitter pages. Other project didn't consider this aspect 

**Consistency**, layout and general design style remains consistent throughout the website.

**Control**, navigation bar is always present in every screen. User always has the ability of what they want to do from where they are.

**No/Prevent Errors**, dialog box makes it clear to the user what will happen after the user has made a choice. Buttons are self-descriptive.

**No errors**, a confirmation dialogue appears when the user chooses to edit or delete their question, this ensures that the user doesn’t accidentally edit/delete the question.

**Help**, users can give feedback to PeerWise via a feedback form

**Minimalism**, guidelines about creating questions are shown in a separate window, to reduce the amount of text on screen for the creating a question page

**Shortcuts**, the navigation bar allows the user to jump to different pages of the website

**Status**, when the user hovers over a row in the table it darkens

## Cons:

**Consistency**, main background colour for webpages is not consistent, i.e. dark grey, dark blue and light blue are all background colours.

**Status**, Lacks status ideas such as loading and progression bars, however this is a mockup design and doesn't implement all 'active' features

**Minimal Design**, I feel like it's just a bit too much colour. Not a huge fan of using blue as background colour.

**Minimal Design**, Some areas are over crowded with text
